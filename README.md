## MAST Overview
This document is a guide to setting up a MAST server and mobile application instance from scratch. It is designed to be used in conjunction with the MAST Implementation Guide and serves as a technical manual for all the technology components that underlie the MAST platform. The intended audience is software developers, systems administrators, and other technical specialists.

It is assumed that the user has reasonable familiarity with Linux servers, Java applications, databases, and Android applications. Working knowledge of git and other tools will also be necessary. This guide makes extensive use of the Linux command line and assumes that the user has a Linux development environment available for use, though a Windows or OSX computer can certainly be used with some modifications.

A complete deployment of MAST requires, at a minimum, a server and enough Android devices to meet the projectâ€™s needs. The server can be a physical server or a cloud server, and this guide provides information for both use cases. Android devices may be mobile phones or tablets, but should run Android 4+ and have an onboard GPS unit with sufficient accuracy to map land parcels. For improved accuracy, it is recommended that you use an external GPS unit connected to the mobile device via Bluetooth or USB.
